General Information:

This is a blockchain application that demonstrates passing ether between accounts using Hardhat, Web3 js, React js, Node js, Express js, and MongoDB.  In the beginning, the transaction history screen will be empty.  When a user clicks one of the blockchain addresses in the addresses screen, they will be presented with an input field where they can enter a value.  Once a value is entered and the submit button is pressed, the account that's displayed in the wallet screen will have an updated balance with the added value that was passed from the previous blockchain address.  Everytime a transaction is sent, the transaction history screen will be updated with information about the transaction, if the user provided their own MongoDB connection
string.
